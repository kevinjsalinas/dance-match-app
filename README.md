# Dance Match App


## About

This app helps users match with dance instructors based on their skill level and dance style preference. Then, they have the option to filter through the list of instructors via pricing or rating. Also, if the user is curious to see how many students are enrolling in their curriculum, they have the option to see all students enrolled. Once the user is happy with their decision, they can book a session with their chosen instructor and be added to the list of lessons.
